          <h1>VPN</h1>
          <strong>What Is a VPN and What Can (and Can’t) It Do?</strong>
          <p>
VPN (or virtual private network) services create a secure, encrypted connection between your computer and a VPN server at another location. That type of secure connection is a worthwhile investment for anyone who wants to wrap their data in an extra layer of privacy and security, especially when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. But a VPN is not a magic bullet for Internet security and won’t make you anonymous online.
<br>
<br>
<strong>How a VPN works</strong> 
<br>
Normally your connection—and the data carried over it—goes from your computer to your local Wi-Fi or network router, then bounces on through your ISP’s network and off to the destination server (like wirecutter.com), eventually returning with the requested data (like this webpage). At any stop along the way, someone could theoretically see the data and where it’s coming from and going to.
<br>
Connecting through a VPN, though, encrypts all of the Internet traffic between your computer and the VPN server, preventing anyone on your local network, or at connection points along the way, from monitoring or modifying your traffic. Beyond the VPN server (in other words, the rest of the way to whatever Internet server you’re connecting to), your traffic mixes with traffic from other people on the same VPN—someone monitoring the connection to the destination server could see that your traffic came from the VPN server, but wouldn’t be able to know it was destined for your computer or device. Though these extra steps and encryption layers slow down any Internet connection, the best VPN providers have connections that are speedy enough to keep browsing and online services snappy.
<br>
You don’t need to understand exactly how a VPN works to use one, but you do need to know what a VPN is good for—and what it’s not—before choosing whether or not to pay for one. We run through the most common uses, and how well a VPN works for each, below.

            <h1>Pixel Slate hands-on: Google’s gorgeous Chrome OS tablet features odd choices</h1>
          <p>
            The Pixel 3 may have been the star of the show at Google’s event this week, but the Pixel Slate tablet offers a compelling new product category for the search giant.<br>
            Well, not totally new. A few years ago, Google had the Pixel C, a beautiful Android tablet that was somewhat ahead of its time, given the OS couldn’t even run two apps side-by-side back then.<br>
            The Pixel Slate instead offers a new vision for Google’s tablets, slotting in somewhere between the Pixel C and last year’s Pixelbook. It starts at $599 (sans keyboard) and comes in a wide range of configurations for differing power needs.<br>
            Basically, it’s Google’s take on the Surface concept. Of course, the caveat to this is a scarcity of full-fledged desktop applications; Chrome OS is always improving, but it’s no Windows.<br>
            But unlike the Surface, the Pixel Slate has access to thousands of Android apps, many of them optimized for tablet use. Meanwhile, Chrome OS should promise better battery life and more consistent performance.<br>

            The Apple iPhone XS Max, see our full review, is a big, beautiful iPhone. With the large size and slick glass panels, it is also easy to drop. While it has Apple's strongest glass, putting this expensive phone in a case is a smart move.<br>\
            Gear4 sent along several samples of its various case series for the iPhone XS Max and iPhone X/XS. Cases range in price from $39.99 to $59.99 with the use of D3O material being the focus of protection.<br>

            IPHONE XS MAX CASES<br>
Three Gear4 case options were sent along to test out the iPhone XS Max. One shows off your iPhone, another offers excellent grip and good protection, while the third offers advanced media functionality. Let's take a closer look at each one.<br>

The Battersea case is available now in black and white for $49.99. I tested the black one that has orange highlights and a vibrant orange interior.<br>

The back is textured TPU with ridges and a soft touch finish so you gain excellent grip with your iPhone in this case. The case has a drop resistant rating for up to 16 feet thanks to the extra D3O material incorporated into the design.<br>

The volume buttons and right side button are raised so they are easily manipulated. The ringer switch opening is large enough for me to easily toggle the switch too. The back camera opening supports all iPhone photography with no compromise in quality.<br>
